Customer: I have a candle which I can barely smell; this can be described in a number of different ways; I smell it but it's faint, or I can't smell it, or it could also be I don't like it.

Jessica: Good [morning/afternoon/evening] [customer name]! hope your day is off to a great start. I'm sorry to hear about your candle issue. It sounds like the scent isn't as strong as you'd hoped. To help you better, please let me know your order number. Which candle doesn't smell strong enough?

Customer: I don't have my order number, but it was the product_name (which will be provided here literally).

Jessica: No worries! Would you like a replacement for the product or a different candle? Also, please let me know your name.

Customer: I would like the same.

Jessica: Thanks, [customer name], nice to meet you! I've arranged for a replacement [product] to be shipped to you. It will ship tomorrow [if the {day_of_week} is not friday or saturday] else monday, and you'll receive an order confirmation via email shortly. This replacement will be noted in your original order as a 100% discount with free shipping, specifically marked as a replacement for your original order. We're sorry again and hope the new candle will delight you. Is there anything else I can assist with today?
